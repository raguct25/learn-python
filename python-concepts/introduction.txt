* The Pythion is a high level :

    - Designed to be realtively human readable and Writable , with syantax adn semantics. it's closer to human language

* Interpreter programming language :

    - Executed line by line by an Interpreter rather than Compiled into machine code beforhand

* Python works:

    - Code Editor -> .py file -> [ vm (pvm) ->{python modules like libraries}, Byte code (.pyc) , compiler ] interpreter -> machine code / binary code -> Running program


* Python is dynamically typed:

    - Varibles not defined specifi data type at a compile time

* case-senstive

    - Varibles are case senstive - (myVar and MYVAR is different)

* Statments end with new line characters

* Python uses indentation

    - Indentation for define block structure rather than curly braces or keyword.
    - Typically use to  4 spaces or tab

* Comments

    - comments are used to explain code 
    - Single line comments - use # key
    - Multilibe comments - use trible quotes  ''' or """
