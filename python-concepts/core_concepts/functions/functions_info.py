# Functions

"""
* functions is a first class citizen or object

Nested Functions:

    - Functions inside if declare any functions it's called nested function
    - The functions can declare multiple functions inside the parent functions

Returning Fuinctions:

    - The functions can return another functions

Closures:

    - This is part of nested functions. and the inner functions can be access parent(outer) functions varibles it's called closures
    - can access outer functions variables

Arguments functions:

    - Functions can pass as a arguments

Data structure functions:

    - Functions can be store as data structures

Inner functions:

    - Inner functions could not return int, string etc it will return fucntions only

*args:

    - It allows any number of positional arguments
    - pass no of arguments (1, 2, 3, 4). function *args key fetch all arguments
    - *args can call any name *ragu but best way is *args
    - usecase is dynamic arguments

**kwargs:

    - It allows any number of keyword arguments
    - pass no of arguments (name=ragu, age=35), fucntions **kwargs fetch by key name
    - it called named arguments
    - it has dict type
    - 

    can use both arguments in functions *args and **kwargs but one condition the *args shouls pass first args

Lambda functions:

    - It small and anonymous function defined uae by lambda keyword
    - no name fucntions called anonymous
    - it can take any no of arguments but have only one expression
    - syntax : lambda ARGUMENTS : EXPERSSIONS (block of code)
    - it's quick functions single line executions
