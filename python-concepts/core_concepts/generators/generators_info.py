"""
* its special type of iterable
* Generate values one at a time using yield key : it returns or genrate values one at a time use yield keyword
* memory efficient : no need to store all values at once : memory allocate no and size of memory less than list or tuple or dict initialize

* Generators perform two types

    - Functions
    - Expressions

* functions use by yield keyword
* expressions use by ( ) parenthesis 

* Reterive function or values use by next() and list()
* next() is one by one 
* list() is reterive all

* yield is like a return statement. if once called never next line excute. wait for another next() command
